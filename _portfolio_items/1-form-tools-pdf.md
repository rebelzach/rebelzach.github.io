Mentioned on Engadget [here](http://www.engadget.com/2011/09/12/dear-aunt-tuaw-help-me-collect-and-chart-data-on-the-ipad/) also featured in [this book](http://www.amazon.com/Hand-Held-Hollywoods-Filmmaking-iPhone/dp/0321862945/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1455333439&sr=8-1&keywords=hand+held+hollywood).

Consistently in the top 100 of the Business category on the Apple App Store.

Form Tools PDF is a simple tool that allows you to take any PDF file and fill it out like a typical paper form. The power of Form Tools is the ability to create multiple form entries for multiple people. Capturing the information and signatures of large groups is simple and easy. Quickly email a PDF to a person once they complete the form.

(As of 2013 this app was sold and I am no longer the maintainer of this project)

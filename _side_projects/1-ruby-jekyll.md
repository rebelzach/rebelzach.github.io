title: "Jekyll Events Plugin"
technologies: Ruby, Open Source
role: Creator and Maintainer

Lets you create Jekyll posts that represent future events. They're posts but in the future! Great for schedules and calendars.

A concise Ruby plugin that was written as part of a larger website. Demonstrates my familiarity with Ruby and Gem creation.
